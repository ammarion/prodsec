## Executive Summary

Aircall operates a cloud-native communications platform serving 20,000+ customers globally, built on AWS infrastructure with TypeScript/Node.js architecture and 100+ integrations. While the company has established foundational security measures including encryption and bug bounty programs, it lacks formal security certifications that competitors like RingCentral and 8x8 have achieved. This comprehensive security program combines Phil Venables' strategic framework with Clint Gibler's tactical automation approach to build a world-class security program tailored to Aircall's unique challenges as a global VoIP provider.

## Current State Assessment

### Technology Architecture Strengths
Aircall's **serverless-first AWS architecture** provides inherent security advantages through infrastructure abstraction and automated patching. The platform uses **TLS 1.2 encryption** for data in transit and **AES-256** for data at rest, with a **microservices migration** underway from their Ruby on Rails monolith. Their **TypeScript/Node.js stack** enables modern security tooling integration, while **Datadog monitoring** provides comprehensive observability.

### Critical Security Gaps
The most significant gap is the **absence of SOC 2 Type II and ISO 27001 certifications**, which competitors universally maintain and enterprise customers expect. Aircall lacks **formal GDPR compliance documentation**, **E911/emergency calling compliance** for US markets, and **industry-specific certifications** (HIPAA BAA, PCI DSS) that limit market expansion. The company also needs **data residency options** for APAC regions with localization requirements.

## Phase 1: Face the Right Direction (Months 1-3)

### Executive Commitment and Governance
**Immediate Action**: Appoint the **Director of Product & Infrastructure Security** as interim CISO reporting directly to the CTO, with dotted line to CEO. Establish a **Security Steering Committee** meeting bi-weekly including CTO, CFO, VP Engineering, and VP Legal to ensure cross-functional commitment.

**Risk Governance Structure**: Create a **risk register** managed as rigorously as financial ledgers, with quantified risk assessments using FAIR methodology. Implement **risk appetite statements** defining acceptable risk levels for voice data, customer integrations, and platform availability.

### Critical Vulnerability Assessment
**Third-Party Breach Assessment**: Engage a specialized telecommunications security firm to conduct:
- **VoIP-specific penetration testing** including toll fraud attempts, SIP attacks, and call interception
- **AWS infrastructure security review** covering Lambda functions, API Gateway, and DynamoDB configurations  
- **Integration security assessment** of OAuth implementations and webhook endpoints
- **Backup and disaster recovery testing** including ransomware simulation

**Immediate Remediation Priorities**:
1. **Implement SRTP encryption** for all voice communications (currently using standard RTP)
2. **Deploy Session Border Controllers** with DDoS protection for VoIP infrastructure
3. **Enable AWS GuardDuty** and Security Hub for centralized threat detection
4. **Implement API rate limiting** more aggressive than current 60 requests/minute
